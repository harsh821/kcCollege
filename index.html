			   <h3> prospectus</h3>
			   <p>Kishinchand Chellaram College is one of the premier institutions affiliated to the University of Mumbai and recognized by Government of Maharashtra. It was established in 1954 by the Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board. The college was awarded permanent affiliation by the University of Mumbai within a record span of two years.
Over the years K.C. has established itself as one of the leading colleges in Mumbai. This fact is well supported by excellent results, both at HSC as well as at the University examinations and the number of laurels won by the students.
The Motto of the College is ‘SALVATION THROUGH KNOWLEDGE’. This motto was selected from ancient Sanskrit scriptures. ‘Knowledge’ in the highest sense means acquiring wisdom & understanding, which in turn leads man to ”Moksha” or Salvation.
K.C. prides itself in motivating students to achieve excellence not only in academic fields but also in co-curricular and extracurricular activities. With Dr.(Mrs.) Hemlata K Bagla as the Principal, the Signature Line of the College could well be – “Excellence - the only Compelling Option.”

			   <h3> History</h3>
			   <p>Kishinchand Chellaram College was established in 1954[1] under the aegis of the Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board. It was the second institution that the Management set up in Bombay after it relocated itself in the city, following the aftermath of Partition. The onus of the task was taken up by late founders, principal K.M. Kundnani and barrister Hotchand Advani, who helped set up K.C. College as well as several other educational institutions. Kundnani and Advani were the pillars of that board.[citation needed] [3]

The R. D. National College was the first of the board's institutions and K.C. was the second. The latter came to be reckoned[by whom?] as its flagship institution from where the board's activities were conducted. The plot for the construction of K.C. College was leased from Ratanben Fauzdar for 99 years. Under the draught plan of architect K.M. Gidwani and the management of principal Kundnani, the building was completed in six months. The foundation stone was laid by Shri Dinkarrao Desai, the minister for education.

Students had been admitted from 1 June 1954 but a formal inauguration of the inception of the college was performed by Morarji Desai (the chief minister of Bombay State) on 15 August of the same year. Its first batch comprised 1800 students and, within three years, the numbers have consistently increased.[citation needed]
